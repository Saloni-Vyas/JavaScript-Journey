In JavaScript, comparison of data types can be tricky because of type coercion and the differences between strict (===) and loose (==) equality. Here's an overview of how different data types behave during comparisons:

1. Strict Equality (===)
Compares both value and type.
No type coercion is performed.

2. Loose Equality (==)
Compares value only, after performing type coercion.
Converts operands to the same type before comparison.
