// GETTER AND SETTER IN STACK OVERFLOW 
In programming, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private properties of a class, respectively. They provide a controlled way to interact with an object's data, allowing for validation, logging, or other processing when properties are accessed or updated.

Getters: Methods that retrieve the value of a private property.

Setters: Methods that set or update the value of a private property.


Common Pitfall: Recursive Getter/Setter Calls
A common issue arises when a getter or setter inadvertently calls itself, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow. This can occur if a setter updates a property that triggers the setter again.

Preventing Recursive Calls
To prevent such issues, ensure that setters do not call themselves or other methods that might trigger them. If additional processing is needed when setting a property, consider using a separate method or restructuring the logic to avoid recursion.
