In JavaScript, memory management involves two types of memory: stack and heap. These terms refer to the way memory is allocated and managed for variables, functions, and objects during program execution.

1. Stack Memory
Definition
The stack is a region of memory that operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
It is used to store primitive values (e.g., number, string, boolean) and function calls (execution contexts).
Characteristics
Fast Access: Operations like allocation and deallocation are quick because of the LIFO structure.
Size Limit: The stack has a fixed size, and trying to allocate too much memory may result in a stack overflow.
Automatically Managed: Memory in the stack is automatically freed when variables go out of scope.

2. Heap Memory
Definition
The heap is a region of memory used for storing objects and functions that require dynamic allocation.
It is not structured (unlike the stack) and allows storing large or complex data structures.
Characteristics
Dynamic Size: The heap has no strict size limit (depends on system memory).
Slower Access: Allocation and deallocation take longer than in the stack.
Garbage Collection: JavaScript's garbage collector automatically frees memory in the heap that is no longer reachable.
