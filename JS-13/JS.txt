In JavaScript, scope refers to the context in which variables are defined and accessible. Understanding global scope and local scope is key to managing variable visibility and avoiding conflicts.

1. Global Scope
Definition: Variables declared outside any function or block are in the global scope and are accessible anywhere in the code.
Global Variables: Can be accessed and modified by any function or block.

Characteristics:
Variables declared with var in the global scope become properties of the window object in browsers.
Overusing global variables can lead to conflicts and make debugging harder.

2. Local Scope
Definition: Variables declared inside a function or block are in the local scope and can only be accessed within that function or block.
Local Variables: Not accessible outside their scope.

Function Scope:
Variables declared inside a function are local to that function.

Block Scope:
Variables declared with let or const inside a block { ... } are local to that block.

3. Global vs. Local Variables
If a global variable and a local variable share the same name, the local variable takes precedence within its scope (variable shadowing).

4. Scope Chain
When accessing a variable, JavaScript searches in the current scope, then moves outward to the parent scope, and eventually to the global scope if necessary.


Minimize the use of global variables to avoid conflicts.
Use let or const instead of var to ensure block scoping.
Use meaningful variable names to reduce the likelihood of shadowing.


 Scope Type	    |          Declared In                        |           	Accessibility
  Global	    |    Outside all functions and blocks         |        	Accessible everywhere in the program
  Local	        |    Inside a function or block	              |         Accessible only within that function/block


Understanding scopes helps ensure variable isolation, reduces bugs, and makes the code more maintainable.
