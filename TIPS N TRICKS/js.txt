TIPS AND TRICKS FOR JAVASCRIPT - 

 1. Use const and let instead of var
Why?
var is function-scoped and can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting.

let and const are block-scoped and more predictable.

// Bad
var name = "Alice";

// Good
const name = "Alice"; // Use const if value won't change
let age = 25;          // Use let if value may change
