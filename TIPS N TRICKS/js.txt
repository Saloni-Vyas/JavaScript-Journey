TIPS AND TRICKS FOR JAVASCRIPT - 

 1. Use const and let instead of var
Why?
var is function-scoped and can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting.

let and const are block-scoped and more predictable.

// Bad
var name = "Alice";

// Good
const name = "Alice"; // Use const if value won't change
let age = 25;          // Use let if value may change

2. Destructuring Objects and Arrays
Why?
Cleaner and more readable code.

Easier extraction of properties or elements.

// Object Destructuring
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name); // Alice

// Array Destructuring
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
const [first, second] = colors;
console.log(second); // green
