Control Flow in JavaScript :
Control flow refers to the order in which the code in a program is executed. JavaScript executes code from top to bottom by default, but control flow structures allow you to alter this order to handle decision-making, looping, and error handling.

1. Sequential Flow -
By default, JavaScript executes statements one after another, from top to bottom.

2. Conditional Statements -
Control flow can change based on conditions.

if Statement
Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

if-else Statement
Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if it is false.

if-else if-else Statement
Handles multiple conditions.

2. Switch Statement -
A cleaner way to compare a single value against multiple cases.

3. Loops -
Loops allow repeated execution of code blocks based on a condition.

for Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.

while Loop
Executes as long as a condition is true.

do-while Loop
Executes at least once, even if the condition is false.

for...of Loop
Iterates over iterable objects like arrays.

for...in Loop
Iterates over the properties of an object.

4. Error Handling -
Used to handle exceptions and maintain control flow during errors.

try-catch
Executes code in the try block, and if an error occurs, the catch block handles it.

try-catch-finally
The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an error occurred.

5. Jump Statements -
break
Exits a loop or switch statement.

continue
Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.

6. Function Calls:
Functions can be invoked to transfer control to reusable blocks of code.


Control flow determines the order of execution in a JavaScript program.
Use conditionals (if, switch) for decision-making.
Use loops (for, while, do...while) for repetition.
Use error-handling constructs (try...catch) to manage exceptions.
Leverage break, continue, and functions for better control over execution.
