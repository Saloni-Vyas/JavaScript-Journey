In JavaScript, functions can work with objects and arrays as parameters, allowing you to pass complex data structures and perform operations on them. Here's a detailed explanation with examples:

Functions with Objects as Parameters
You can pass an object to a function to access its properties or manipulate it.

Modify an Object
Objects in JavaScript are passed by reference, so changes to the object inside the function will affect the original object.

Destructuring Object Parameters
You can use destructuring to extract specific properties directly in the parameter list.


Functions with Arrays as Parameters
You can pass an array to a function and perform operations like accessing elements, iterating, or modifying them.

Modify an Array
Like objects, arrays are also passed by reference.

Destructuring Array Parameters
You can destructure arrays in the parameter list to extract specific elements.


Combining Objects and Arrays
You can pass a combination of objects and arrays to a function, allowing more complex data structures.


Summary
Objects: Useful for passing structured data with named properties.
Arrays: Ideal for passing lists or collections.
Destructuring: Simplifies access to specific properties or elements.
Pass by Reference: Changes to objects/arrays inside a function affect the original.
These concepts enable flexible and efficient data handling in JavaScript functions.
