Objects in JavaScript
An object is a collection of key-value pairs where keys (also called properties) are strings (or symbols), and values can be any data type. Objects are a fundamental data type in JavaScript used to model real-world entities.

1. Creating Objects
Object Literal (most common):
Using new Object():
Using a Constructor Function:
Using Classes:

2. Accessing Properties

Bracket Notation (useful for dynamic keys):

3. Adding or Updating Properties

4. Deleting Properties

5. Checking Properties

6. Iterating Over Properties

7. Methods in Objects

9. Object Shorthand and Destructuring
 Property Shorthand:
 Destructuring:


Objects are mutable and are compared by reference, not by value.
Use Object.freeze(obj) to make an object immutable.
Objects are a core feature of JavaScript and form the basis of complex data structures like classes and prototypes.
