In JavaScript, let, const, and var are used to declare variables. Here's a breakdown of their differences and use cases:

1. var
Scope: Function-scoped. A variable declared with var is accessible within the function it is declared, or globally if declared outside a function.
Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope but are undefined until the code execution reaches the declaration.
Redeclaration: Can be redeclared within the same scope without errors

2. let
Scope: Block-scoped. A variable declared with let is accessible only within the block it is declared.
Hoisting: Variables declared with let are hoisted, but they remain in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) until the code execution reaches the declaration. Accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError.
Redeclaration: Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

3. const
Scope: Block-scoped, like let.
Hoisting: Similar to let, const is hoisted but remains in the temporal dead zone until the declaration.
Redeclaration: Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
Reassignment: Cannot be reassigned. However, if the const variable holds an object or array, the contents of the object or array can be modified.
