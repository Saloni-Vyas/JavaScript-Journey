OBJECT DESTRUCTION - 
In JavaScript, object destruction refers to the process of breaking down objects into their individual properties and assigning them to variables using a concise syntax. This is achieved through destructuring assignment.

Destructuring makes the code more concise and readable, especially when dealing with objects that have multiple properties.
